# We have two folders: TEMP and ARCHIVE. The goal is to move files from TEMP
# to ARCHIVE, but only move the files we don't already have there. We determine
# the uniqueness of a file by file size only (should be sufficient for our
# purposes). The program will first get the sizes of all .png files in ARCHIVE
# and store them in an array. Then it look at all file sizes in TEMP, and if
# it finds a file size that isn't in the array then that file is moved over
# (.png and the corresponding .ppt).
